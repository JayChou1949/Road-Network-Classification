# Classification of Urban Morphology with Deep Learning: Application on Urban Vitality

This repository is the official implementation of [Classification of Urban Morphology with Deep Learning: Application on Urban Vitality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09908). It includes the major codes (written in Python) involved in the paper. We also offer some tractable tutorials in Notebook to show how to use our two modules, `CRHD generator` and `Morphoindex generator`. `CRHD generator` can automatically produce Colored Road Hierarchy Diagram (CRHD) for a given urban area. `Morphoindex generator` can automatically generate both traditional morphological indices based on built environment Shapefiles and road network class probabilities based on our road network classification model.

## Requirements

To use `CRHD generator`, you need to install the requirements:

```setup
pip install osmnx
pip install geopandas
pip install matplotlib
```
To use `Morphoindex generator`, you need to install the additional requirements:

```setup
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install cv2
pip install numpy
```
Also, make sure you have downloaded our pretrained model as well.

## Pre-trained Model

You can download our pretrained models here:

- [Road network classification model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N7T9lN4TL5r8EqduZfWv22ROZO4zp_FN/view?usp=sharing) trained on our labelled image set using ResNet-34 architecture, learning rate as 0.0005, batch size as 2. 


## Results

Our model achieves the following performance on out testing set:
